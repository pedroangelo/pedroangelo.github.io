abstract="In this paper, we extend a rank 2 intersection type system with gradual types. We then show that the problem of finding a principal typing for a lambda term, in a rank 2 gradual intersection type system is decidable. We present a type inference algorithm which builds the principal typing of a term through the generation of type constraints which are solved by a new extended unification algorithm constructing the most general unifier for rank 2 gradual intersection types.",
