### Todo:
- check if I can upload copies of my papers online
- avoid writing the same html code for the list of papers, include an html generator that takes the list of papers from json and outputs the html code
- allow to include from different html pages, possibly by defining an include function through javascript, include header with navigation bar
- add css styling to make the website more appealing
- allow responsive design
